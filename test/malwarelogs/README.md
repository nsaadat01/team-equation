Look through these log files, do EDA to find any common themes within these malware log files.
The layout is this for each malware:

1 regshot file (took one register shot before running the malware, and one after)

1 network log for the ethernet

1 process monitor log


The files are too big to fit on here, so I am sending them to my team to filter and update. For the procmon, remove the time stamp column. Then, see what the most common features in each column are (ie, list of how frequently different processes, PID, operation are), and how common different column combos are (ie, what are the most common "process + PID", the most common "process + PID + Operation", and so on).

For wireshark, do the same thing. You can remove the 'No' and the time column, as they are ultimately irrelevant. Start seeing which source, destination, protocol, length, info are the most common, and then start seeing which combinations are more common (ie, which "source + destination + protocol" is the most common, etc). 


Try seeing common trends between different malware files, and more importantly, try seeing the common things between a malware file and a nonmalware file. These are common processes that should be removed from the data that we are cleaning.

Like I am going to give an example:
"1","0.000000","169.254.40.200","255.255.255.255","UDP","60","58662  >  8610 Len=16" shows up 1000 times in malware
"1","0.000000","169.254.40.200","255.255.255.255","UDP","60","58662  >  8610 Len=16" shows up 1001 times in nonmalware

Just get rid of "1","0.000000","169.254.40.200","255.255.255.255","UDP","60","58662  >  8610 Len=16"


Another example, 
"13","14.127519","fe80::4c4a:5cee:4148:ab63","ff02::1:3","LLMNR","95","Standard query 0xb929 ANY DESKTOP-HA5TC5S" shows up 1000 times in non malware

"13","14.127519","fe80::4c4a:5cee:4148:ab63","ff02::1:3","LLMNR","95","Standard query 0xb929 ANY DESKTOP-HA5TC5S"
shows up 6000 times in malware

Try removing 1000 iterations of "13","14.127519","fe80::4c4a:5cee:4148:ab63","ff02::1:3","LLMNR","95","Standard query 0xb929 ANY DESKTOP-HA5TC5S" from each file.

Additionally, research into which processes are the most common, and try to understand what they do.
